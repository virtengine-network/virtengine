# openfleet (deprecated)

This package has been renamed to `@virtengine/openfleet`.

You can find openfleet at : https://github.com/virtengine/virtengine/tree/main/scripts/openfleet

Or in NPM: http://npmjs.com/package/@virtengine/openfleet

`openfleet` now acts as a legacy shim that forwards all CLI commands to the
latest `@virtengine/openfleet` binaries.

## Install (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @virtengine/openfleet
```

## Legacy install

```bash
npm install -g openfleet
```

This legacy install will provide these commands (forwarded to openfleet):

- `openfleet`
- `openfleet-setup`
- `openfleet-chat-id`
- `openfleet-shared-workspaces`

## Notes

- Use `openfleet` going forward.
- If you see deprecation warnings, they are expected and safe.
