# VirtEngine Progress

Last updated: 2026-02-22
Status: **83A workspace isolation DONE; 83B/83C partially implemented; 83D not started.** Chain tasks (80A-82B) can now proceed — workspace isolation blocker resolved. Remaining sandbox gaps (83C) are mitigated by `skipGitRepoCheck` workaround.

## 83A-83D Implementation Audit (2026-02-22)

### 83A: Workspace Isolation — ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (8/8 criteria)

All acceptance criteria verified with code evidence:

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Agents execute in workspace path | ✅ | `resolveAgentRepoRoot()` in config.mjs:867, agent-pool.mjs:61 |
| 2 | REPO\_ROOT no longer forces developer repo | ✅ | Priority inversion at config.mjs:868, repo-root.mjs:82 |
| 3 | `bosun --setup` auto-clones + verifies .git | ✅ | Interactive setup.mjs:4453 + non-interactive setup.mjs:4684 |
| 4 | Daemon startup auto-clones missing repos | ✅ | Bootstrap at monitor.mjs:559-594, pullWorkspaceRepos import at L209 |
| 5 | Sandbox writable roots include .git | ✅ | codex-config.mjs:437 adds .git per root |
| 6 | Worktrees under workspace .cache/worktrees/ | ✅ | worktree-manager.mjs:192 uses BOSUN\_AGENT\_REPO\_ROOT |
| 7 | Developer repo untouched | ✅ | All paths resolve via workspace root; REPO\_ROOT = "developer root for config only" |
| 8 | Graceful fallback to REPO\_ROOT | ✅ | monitor.mjs:547 chdir fallback, repo-root.mjs:96 resolution chain |

**Verdict: Task can be marked `done`.**

### 83B: Multi-Repo Task Routing — 🔶 ~70% IMPLEMENTED (3/6 full, 3/6 partial)

| # | Criterion | Status | Gap |
|---|-----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Per-repo worktrees (waldur) | ✅ | `_resolveTaskRepoContext()` → per-repo WorktreeManager |
| 2 | Per-repo worktrees (virtengine) | ✅ | Same mechanism with primary fallback |
| 3 | Per-repo default branches | 🔶 | Global `branchRouting` works; **no per-repo `defaultBranch` in config schema** |
| 4 | Periodic workspace repo sync | 🔶 | Bootstrap-time sync exists; **no `setInterval` periodic re-sync or `workspace-sync.mjs`** |
| 5 | PR uses correct repo slug | 🔶 | Slug resolved per-task + env vars set; **`gh pr create` lacks `--repo` flag** |
| 6 | Backward-compatible single-repo | ✅ | Clean fallbacks when `repositories: []` |

**Remaining work (3 items):**
1. Add `defaultBranch` field to `repositories[]` config; wire into `resolveTaskBaseBranch()`
2. Add periodic workspace sync interval in monitor.mjs maintenance cycle
3. Pass `--repo ${executionRepoSlug}` to `gh pr create` when targeting secondary repos

### 83C: Codex Sandbox .git Resolution — 🔶 ~50% IMPLEMENTED (3/6 full, 1/6 partial, 2/6 missing)

| # | Criterion | Status | Gap |
|---|-----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | No "sandbox expects .git" errors | ✅ | `skipGitRepoCheck: true` at agent-pool.mjs:583,1958 |
| 2 | Worktree dirs have parent .git access | 🔶 | Parent dir added generically; **no `.git` file parsing for worktree refs** |
| 3 | Auto-detect full-write-access | ✅ | `disk-full-write-access` default; idempotent guard |
| 4 | `ensureGitAncestor()` for .git files | ❌ | **Function does not exist**; no `.git` file→gitdir resolution |
| 5 | Per-task writable roots cleanup | ❌ | **No `addTemporaryWritableRoot()`/cleanup**; TOML roots are permanent |
| 6 | Existing SDK launchers work | ✅ | All 3 launchers (Codex/Copilot/Claude) + dispatcher intact |

**Remaining work (3 items):**
1. Implement `ensureGitAncestor(dir)` — walk up, parse worktree `.git` files (`gitdir:` refs)
2. Implement `addTemporaryWritableRoot(path)` + cleanup in `executeTask()` post-completion
3. Add `worktreePath` parameter to `ensureSandboxWorkspaceWrite()`

**Note:** The `skipGitRepoCheck: true` workaround effectively mitigates the original error — agents CAN launch. The missing items are architectural hardening, not blockers.

### 83D: Workspace Health Dashboard — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (0/7 full, 2/7 partial)

| # | Criterion | Status | Gap |
|---|-----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | `bosun workspace status` CLI | ❌ | No subcommand exists |
| 2 | `bosun workspace repair` CLI | ❌ | Worktree cleanup in maintenance.mjs but not exposed as CLI |
| 3 | `--json` output | ❌ | No JSON flag on workspace commands |
| 4 | UI Workspace tab | ❌ | Not in TAB\_CONFIG; no workspace tab file |
| 5 | REST API `/api/workspace/*` | ❌ | No routes exist |
| 6 | Telegram health alerts | 🔶 | Agent stuck alerts exist; no repo/worktree health alerts |
| 7 | Maintenance cycle health check | 🔶 | Worktree pruning exists via maintenance.mjs; no holistic health report |

**Foundation exists:** workspace-monitor.mjs (582 lines) tracks active agents for stuck detection; maintenance.mjs has `cleanupWorktrees()`. Neither constitutes the health dashboard described in 83D.

## Delta since 2026-02-11 (prior analysis)

### Summary

No chain module PRs merged since 2026-02-11. The 8 chain tasks (80A-82B) remain in `todo`. However, **83A is now fully implemented** — the workspace isolation blocker that prevented agent execution is resolved. Agents should now be able to execute chain tasks in workspace repos.

### Task execution status

**No chain tasks have been executed since the kanban migration** — all 8 chain tasks (80A-82B) remain in `todo`. However, the workspace isolation blocker (83A) is now **fully implemented**, meaning agents should be able to execute chain tasks going forward.

### Kanban state

11 draft (Bosun UI) + 12 todo (8 chain + 4 workspace) = 23 tasks. 83A should be marked `done`.

## CRITICAL BLOCKER: Workspace Isolation Failure

### Problem

Agents execute in `/home/jon/repos/virtengine` (the developer's active working directory) instead of `~/bosun/workspaces/virtengine/virtengine/` (the isolated workspace clone). This causes:

1. **Sandbox `.git` resolution failure** — Codex bwrap sandbox can't find `.git` when CWD is outside git repo
2. **Agent/developer conflicts** — agents and developer share the same git index, causing conflicts
3. **Worktree pollution** — worktrees created inside developer's repo pollute their working copy
4. **Non-functional workspace clone** — `~/bosun/workspaces/virtengine/virtengine/` exists but has NO `.git` (clone never completed)

### 12-Link Root Cause Chain (fully traced)

| # | File:Line | Issue |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | `~/bosun/.env` | `REPO_ROOT=/home/jon/repos/virtengine` hardcoded |
| 2 | `repo-root.mjs:21` | `process.env.REPO_ROOT` checked first, always wins |
| 3 | `config.mjs:283` | `detectRepoRoot()` — env var first in priority |
| 4 | `config.mjs:831` | `repoRootOverride = process.env.REPO_ROOT` |
| 5 | `config.mjs:927` | `repoRoot = repoRootOverride \|\| selectedRepository?.path` — override wins |
| 6 | `monitor.mjs:533` | `process.chdir(repoRoot)` → developer's repo |
| 7 | `agent-pool.mjs:52` | `REPO_ROOT = resolveRepoRoot()` → developer's repo |
| 8 | `task-executor.mjs:3326` | `executionRepoRoot` → developer's repo |
| 9 | `worktree-manager.mjs:288` | worktrees under developer's `.cache/worktrees/` |
| 10 | `codex-config.mjs:1110` | sandbox writes only for developer's repo path |
| 11 | `monitor.mjs` (startup) | NO `pullWorkspaceRepos` call during daemon startup |
| 12 | `setup.mjs:4453` | Cloning only in interactive setup, not non-interactive |

### Resolution

Tasks 83A-83D created to fix this end-to-end (see Planned Tasks section below).

## Critical Path to Patent Compliance

### Infrastructure Blocker (P0 — Blocks all agent execution)

0. **~~Workspace isolation failure~~ (83A ✅ RESOLVED, 83B/83C gaps remain)** — Core isolation (83A) is fully implemented: agents now use `~/bosun/workspaces/<ws>/<repo>` via `resolveAgentRepoRoot()`. Sandbox `.git` error mitigated via `skipGitRepoCheck: true`. Remaining 83B gaps: per-repo branch routing, periodic sync, PR `--repo` flag. Remaining 83C gaps: `ensureGitAncestor()`, per-task writable root cleanup. **These are hardening items, not blockers — chain tasks CAN proceed.**

### Chain Blockers (P0 — Must fix before any demo/audit)

1. **Chain Submitter BroadcastTx is a no-op** (pkg/provider\_daemon/chain\_submitter.go:461) — The entire marketplace cannot function if providers can't submit transactions
2. **Staking rewards/slashing are placeholders** (x/staking/keeper/slashing.go:147, rewards.go:140) — Patent Claim 7 requires real PoS economics
3. **Proto generation pipeline not automated** — 10 modules use hand-rolled stubs instead of generated code from existing .proto defs in sdk/proto/node/

### High Priority (P1 — Required for completeness)

4. **Resources module minimal** — 1.7k LOC, 241 test LOC, no capacity reservation
5. **HPC node-level rewards not implemented** — settlement.go:585 TODO
6. **Oracle has no external data ingestion** — Price feeds defined but nothing pushes data in
7. **Fraud/review not integrated with escrow** — Dispute lifecycle exists but doesn't hold/release escrow
8. **End-to-end marketplace flow untested** — Individual modules work but no integration proof

### Planned Tasks (80A-83D) — Bosun task store

## Execution Priority Sequence

Phase 0 (✅ RESOLVED): **83A done** → 83B, 83C have remaining gaps (hardening, not blocking)
Phase 1 (P0 parallel — **NOW UNBLOCKED**): 80A, 80B, 80C — Chain integration, staking economics, proto pipeline
Phase 2 (P1 parallel): 81A, 81B, 81C — HPC rewards, oracle/BME, fraud/enclave
Phase 3 (P1 parallel): 82A, 82B — IBC bridging, roles/audit/governance

**83A is complete.** Agents now resolve to workspace repos via `resolveAgentRepoRoot()`. Chain tasks 80A-82B can proceed. The 83B/83C remaining gaps (per-repo branch config, periodic sync, ensureGitAncestor, temp writable roots) are hardening items that can be addressed in parallel with chain work.
